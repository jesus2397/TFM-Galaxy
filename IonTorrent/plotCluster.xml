**What is a dendrogram?**\

Also known as *tree diagram*, it is a diagram that shows hierarchical relationships between differents components or objects. To interprete a dendrogram is precise to analyse height between all components. Components that have same height are similar between them. Nevertheless, components with different height have got more different between them.\

**Dendrogram tool**\

It represents hierarchical relationships between different samples that user introduce in IonTorrent. Also, different samples appears whit different colour: black, red and green. Red colour is for samples with I condition, black is for samples with H condition and green is for samples with J condition.\


**Example**\

           :height: 900
           :width: 900
